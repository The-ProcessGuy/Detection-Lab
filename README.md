# Detection-Lab - (NERCIP)

## Objective
The purpose of this assessment is to -
- Evaluate Cybersecurity Maturity: Identify the current state of the organization's cybersecurity posture using the CMMI framework.
- Expose Critical Gaps: Highlight key vulnerabilities and weaknesses in foundational security areas.
- Provide Actionable Recommendations: Offer a practical roadmap to help the organization move from a reactive to a proactive cybersecurity strategy.
- Support Executive Decision-Making: Arm leadership with the insights and urgency needed to allocate resources and set priorities for remediation.

## Skills Demonstrated
During the assessment, these practical skills were applied and enhanced:
- Cybersecurity Framework Mapping: Aligning real-world gaps with NIST CSF categories (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover).
- Threat and Vulnerability Analysis: Identifying weak points in access controls, configuration management, and monitoring.
- Incident Response Planning: Understanding the essential components of a functioning response capability.
- Executive Communication: Translating technical findings into business risk terms that executives can act on.
- Project Planning: Creating a phased cybersecurity improvement plan based on risk and difficulty level.

## Tools Used
The assessment made use of several cybersecurity and analysis tools, including:
- Vulnerability Scanners – To quickly identify system weaknesses (e.g., Nessus, Qualys).
- Risk Matrices – For visualizing impact and likelihood of threats.
- Security Frameworks – Mainly NIST CSF and CMMI to evaluate maturity across domains.
- Spreadsheets & Visualization Tools – Used for organizing findings and illustrating maturity scores via bar charts and pie charts.
- SIEM/EPP placeholders – Though not deployed yet, recommendations included tools like Splunk, CrowdStrike, and SentinelOne for future use.
  
## Steps
1. Initial Discovery and Scoping
- Identified key systems, personnel, and environments for review.
- Defined the scope around critical infrastructure per NERC CIP guidelines.

2. Domain-Level Evaluation
- Scored each cybersecurity domain (e.g., Access Control, Network Security, Physical Security) using the CMMI scale (1.0–5.0).
- Gathered data through interviews, document reviews, and basic scans.

3. Findings and Gap Analysis
- Discovered that most domains were at Level 1 (Initial), showing minimal or no formal practices.
- Noted Physical Security as the only domain with a slightly better score (2.0).

4. Risk Prioritization
- Mapped all findings into a risk matrix with severity levels (Critical, High, Medium).
- Assessed business impact, regulatory exposure, and likelihood.

6. Action Plan Creation
- Developed a Cybersecurity Action Plan mapped to NIST CSF.
- Prioritized tasks as Short, Mid, or Long-term with difficulty levels for planning purposes.
- Immediate actions included setting up MFA, restricting admin access, initiating vulnerability scans, and developing an incident response plan.

6. Resource Planning
- Estimated staffing needs (e.g., CISO, cybersecurity analysts, IR specialists).
- Budgeted $500K–$1M for technology investments, tools, and training.

7. Reporting and Delivery
- Compiled findings and recommendations into a structured, visual, and executive-friendly report.
- Shared the report with leadership for immediate decision-making and implementation.
